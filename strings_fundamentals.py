# Create a function called username_generator take two inputs, first_name and last_name and returns a user_name. 
# The username should be a slice of the first three letters of their first name and the first four letters of their last name. 
# If their first name is less than three letters or their last name is less than four letters it should use their entire names.
# For example, if the employeeâ€™s name is Abe Simpson the function should generate the username AbeSimp.

def username_generator(first_name, last_name):
  if len(first_name) < 3:
    user_name = first_name
  else:
    user_name = first_name[0:3]
  if len(last_name) < 4:
    user_name += last_name
  else:
    user_name += last_name[0:4]
  return user_name

# Now for the temporary password, they want the function to take the input user name and shift all of the letters by one to the right, 
# so the last letter of the username ends up as the first letter and so forth. For example, if the username is AbeSimp, then the temporary password 
# generated should be pAbeSim.
# Start by defining a function called password_generator that takes one parameter user_name and defines an empty string named password within the function body.

# Inside password_generator, create a for loop that iterates through the indices of user_name by going from 0 to len(user_name).
# The loop should create the password by shifting all the letters of user_name one to the right. To do so, add the letter at the previous index of user_name to 
# password with each pass of the loop.
# After the for loop but still within the definition of password_generator, return the password.

def password_generator(user_name):
  password = ""
  for i in range(0, len(user_name)):
    password += user_name[i-1]
  return password
